## Fabrication And Welding

At F W Frost, our skilled Fabrication department specializes in producing high-quality fabrications and precision sheet metal parts from a range of materials including Mild Steel, Stainless Steel, and Aluminium in varying thicknesses. A key capability is our ability to machine components after fabrication, ensuring the achievement of the high tolerances critical for many applications.

## Cutting & Folding

Our in-house processing includes cutting and folding, facilitated by our Gade guillotine and Amada HFE/M2 220 CNC press, which allows us to handle sheet materials up to 4 meters in length. This capacity ensures we are well-equipped for both small-scale components and larger, heavy fabrications.

## Dull Polishing

Adding to our finishing capabilities, we now offer dull polishing for Stainless Steel up to 600mm wide, using our Grindingmaster 2000. This enhances the surface finish of fabricated parts where required.

## Coded Welders

Furthermore, our certified fabricators provide coded welding across a variety of materials, ensuring that all welding procedures meet the necessary standards and can be tailored precisely to individual customer requirements.

Central to F W Frost's operation is our philosophy of working closely with customers. We strive to build strong relationships founded on consistently delivering quality workmanship and ensuring reliable, on-time deliveries for every project.
