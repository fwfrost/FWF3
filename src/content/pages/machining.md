## Machining

FW Frost has continually invested in the latest CNC/CAD/CAM technologies, the latest purchase being a Haas VF9 machining centre and Harrison 1400XS lathe.

Thanks to this consistent investment in state-of-the-art technology, our CNC machining service also allows for fast changeovers between projects. This means we can consistently meet your project deadlines, delivering high quality machined components on time.

Commonly placed orders include the use of a wide variety of materials including; aluminium, mild & stainless steel, copper, brass, titanium, and plastics.

Our highly skilled machine shop has the ability to produce both large and small components using both manual and 4 Axis Milling & Live Tooling CNC Lathes, along with these machines we have a large range of manual and CNC machining centres.

Both our Scharmann Horizontal Boring machines have a five-tonne table capacity and can machine parts larger than most workshops.

### CAD/CAM

We are able to generate machining programs from customers 3D Models using our ONECNC Software, this ensures parts are accurate to the clients model and drawings.

### Inspection

Having invested in both a Faro Gage and Axiom too 1200 CMM in recent years has allowed FW Frost to improve upon and replace multiple manual inspection tools, these have delivered added convenience, speed, and accuracy.
