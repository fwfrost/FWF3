## Machining

FW Frost has continually invested in the latest CNC/CAD/CAM technologies, the latest purchase being a Haas EC2000 machining centre.

Thanks to consistent investment in state-of-the-art technology, our CNC machining service also allows for fast changeovers between projects. This means we can consistently meet your project deadlines, delivering high quality machined components on time. Commonly placed orders include the use of a wide variety of materials including; aluminium, mild & stainless steel, copper, brass, titanium, and plastics.

Our highly skilled machine shop has the ability to produce both large and small components using both manual and 4 Axis Milling & Live Tooling CNC Lathes, along with these machines we have a large range of manual and CNC machining centres.

We can generate machining programs from customers 3D Models using our ONECNC Software & then inspect using our Faro Gage or CMM.

Both our Scharmann Horizontal Boring machines have a five-tonne table capacity and can face or bore parts of varying shapes and sizes.

We are always able to offer quotations from customer drawings and specifications, and can sometimes offer alternative methods or ideas that have an impact on costs, why not give us a call?
