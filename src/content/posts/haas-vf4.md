## Added Milling Capacity

Back in November 2023, F W Frost Ltd increased its milling machining fleet with the addition of yet another VF4SS after the first VF4SS arrived in December 2019.

The Haas VF4SS is a medium-sized machine with the added bonus of super-speed machining capabilities allowing for faster feed rates and better machining strategies.
